# Agile Blackjack Teacher

A Blackjack learning application designed to teach users the fundamentals of the game, optimal strategy, and card counting mechanics.

Developed as a group project using the Scrum/Agile Methodologies. 

## Overview

Our blackjack application is centered around learning the game. It caters to those who have never played as well as players looking to learn more advanced stragies such as card counting. Users will be walked through interactive scenarios to practice different aspects of the game and given a no risk environment to practice. 

The project was built with QT Creator and written primarily in C++. We chose QT to leverage the powerful signal and slot system for real time updates. QT Designer allowed us to easily design our UI.

### Key Features

* **Practice Mode:** Fully playable with betting and feedback when you make a poor decision.
* **Customizable Ruleset:** Allows customizing deck count, dealer hit on soft 17, and other common variations.

### Development Process

This project was built over 2 sprints using the **Scrum** framework. Our team focused on iterative delivery and maintaining a high-quality codebase. It was each of our first times following the scrum framework so the project served as a trial run to learn the Agile processes.

* **Workflow:** We utilized a project board, held Daily Stand-ups, and conducted Sprint Retrospectives to improve team velocity.
* **Collaboration:** Managed via Git with a Feature-Branch workflow and Peer Code Reviews.

### My Specific Contributions
* **[Contribution 1]:** Backend logic for the bulk of the practice mode. 
* **[Contribution 2]:** Implemented rulset menu to allow for customize rule configuration. 
* **[Contribution 3]:** Debugging various issues such as splitting and blackjack payout.
